## Overview

The f5 module enables Puppet management of LTM F5 load balancers by providing types and REST-based providers.  The Puppet, Inc. versions (<= v1.5.4) of this module are no longer in development.  That module has been merged with the development efforts of F5.  Starting with v1.6.0, BIG-IP module development will be handled by F5.

## Warning

Per the information in the [Overview](#overview), this module cannot be used in conjunction with the former, deprecated module under the namespace of [puppetlabs/f5](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/f5).  The [puppetlabs/f5](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/f5) module must be removed before you installing this module.  This is recommended as this module will be the only actively maintained module in the future.

## Module Description

This module uses REST to manage various aspects of F5 load balancers, and acts
as a foundation for building higher level abstractions within Puppet.

The module allows you to manage nodes, pools, applications, and application service, in order to manage much of your F5 configuration through Puppet.

## Setup

### Beginning with f5

Before you can use the f5 module, you must create a proxy system able to run `puppet device`. Your Puppet agent will serve as the "proxy system" for the `puppet device` subcommand.

Create a device.conf file in the Puppet conf directory (either /etc/puppet or /etc/puppetlabs/puppet) on the Puppet agent. Within your device.conf, you must have:

~~~
[bigip]
type f5
url https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<IP ADDRESS OF BIGIP>/
~~~

In the above example, `<USERNAME>` and `<PASSWORD>` refer to Puppet's login for the device.

Additionally, you must install the faraday gem into the Puppet Ruby environment on the proxy host (Puppet agent) by declaring the `f5` class on that host. If you do not install the faraday gem, the module will not work.

## Usage example

### Set up two load-balanced web servers.

#### Before you begin

This example assumes the following pre-existing infrastructure:

1. A server running as a Puppet master.
2. A Puppet agent running as a proxy or controller to the f5 device.
3. A f5 device that has been registered with the Puppet master via the proxy or controller.

The F5 device contains a management VLAN, a client VLAN to contain the virtual server, and a server VLAN to connect to the two web servers the module sets up.

To load balance requests between 2 webservers using the BIG-IP, you must know the following information about your systems:

1. The IP addresses of both of the web servers;
2. The names of the nodes each web server will be on;
3. The ports the web servers are listening on; and
4. The IP address of the virtual server.

### Steps

1.  Classify the f5 device with the required resource types.
2.  Apply classification to the device from the proxy or controller by running `puppet device -v --user=root`.

See below for the detailed steps.

#### Step One: Classifying your servers

In your site.pp, `<devicecertname>.pp` node manifest, or a `profiles::<profile_name>` manifest file, enter the below code in the relevant class statement or node declaration:

~~~puppet
  f5_node { '/Common/WWW_Server_1':
    ensure                   => 'present',
    address                  => '172.16.226.10',
    description              => 'WWW Server 1',
    availability_requirement => 'all',
    health_monitors          => ['/Common/icmp'],
  }
  f5_node { '/Common/WWW_Server_2':
    ensure                   => 'present',
    address                  => '172.16.226.11',
    description              => 'WWW Server 2',
    availability_requirement => 'all',
    health_monitors          => ['/Common/icmp'],
  }
  f5_pool { '/Common/puppet_pool':
    ensure                    => 'present',
    members                   => [
      { name => '/Common/WWW_Server_1', port => '80', },
      { name => '/Common/WWW_Server_2', port => '80', },
    ],
    availability_requirement  => 'all',
    health_monitors           => ['/Common/http_head_f5'],
    require                   => [
      F5_node['/Common/WWW_Server_1'],
      F5_node['/Common/WWW_Server_2'],
    ],
  }
  f5_virtualserver { '/Common/puppet_vs':
    ensure                     => 'present',
    provider                   => 'standard',
    default_pool               => '/Common/puppet_pool',
    destination_address        => '192.168.80.100',
    destination_mask           => '255.255.255.255',
    http_profile               => '/Common/http',
    service_port               => '80',
    protocol                   => 'tcp',
    source_address_translation => 'automap',
    source                     => '0.0.0.0/0',
    vlan_and_tunnel_traffic    => {'enabled' => ['/Common/Client']},
    require                    => F5_pool['/Common/puppet_pool'],
  }
~~~

**The order of your resources is extremely important.** You must first establish your two web servers. In the code above, they are `f5_node { '/Common/WWW_Server_1'...` and `f5_node { '/Common/WWW_Server_2'...`. Each has the minimum number of parameters possible and is set up with a health monitor that pings each server directly to make sure it is still responsive.

Next, establish the pool of servers. The pool is also set up with the minimum number of parameters. The health monitor for the pool runs an https request to see that a webpage is returned.

Finally, the virtual server brings your setup together. Your virtual server **must** have a `provider` assigned.

If you're using a profile, remember to apply the profile to the node with either the console, your ENC, or site.pp.

#### Step Two: Run puppet device

Run the following command to have the device proxy node generate a certificate and apply your classifications to the F5 device.

~~~
$ puppet device -v --user=root
~~~

If you do not run this command, clients can not make requests to the web servers.

At this point, your basic web servers should be up and fielding requests.

(Note: Due to [a bug](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1391), passing `--user=root` is required, even though the command is already run as root.)

### Tips and Tricks

#### Basic usage

Once you've established a basic configuration, you can explore the providers and their allowed options by running `puppet resource <TYPENAME>` for each type. (**Note:** You must have your authentification credentials in `FACTER_url` within your command, or `puppet resource` will not work.) This provides a starting point for seeing what's already on your F5. If anything failed to set up properly, it will not show up when you run the command.

To begin with, call the types from the proxy system.

~~~
$ FACTER_url=https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<IP ADDRESS OF BIGIP> puppet resource f5_node
~~~

To manage the device (create, modify, or remove resources), classify the bigip
just as you would classify any other Puppet node (site.pp, ENC,
Console, etc.), using the device certname specified in device.conf.
Then run `puppet device -v` on the proxy node as you would normally use the
`puppet agent` command.

#### Role and profiles

The [above example](#set-up-two-load-balanced-web-servers) is for setting up a simple configuration of two web servers. However, for anything more complicated, use the roles and profiles pattern when classifying nodes or devices for F5.

#### Custom HTTP monitors

If you have a '/Common/http_monitor' (which is available by default), then when you are creating a '/Common/custom_http_monitor' you can use just `parent_monitor => '/Common/http'`, so that you don't have to duplicate all values.

## Reference

#### Notes

* The defaults for any given type's parameters are determined by your F5, which varies based on your environment and version. Please consult [F5's documentation](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm.html) to discover the defaults pertinent to your setup.
* All resource type titles are required to be in the format of `/Partition/title`, such as `/Common/my_virtualserver`.

If the connection is not made in the time specified, the connection request is removed from the queue and reset. Defaults to '0', which allows unlimited time in the queue.
